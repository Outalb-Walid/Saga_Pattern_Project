# SAGA  Choreography Pattern for Transcations 
## Chapter 1: General Framework of the Project

### Context and Motivation
This project delves into the intricate realm of transactions within distributed architectures, with a specific emphasis on microservices. In today's digital landscape, where software systems are becoming increasingly distributed and modular, understanding how transactions operate in such environments is paramount to ensuring data integrity, consistency, and reliability.

#### 1.1. General Presentation of Microservices
Microservices, as a architectural paradigm, represent a modular approach to software development where complex applications are composed of small, independent services that communicate with each other via APIs. This approach offers several advantages such as scalability, flexibility, and ease of maintenance.

#### 1.2. Importance of Transactions in Distributed Architectures
Transactions are fundamental to maintaining data consistency and integrity in distributed architectures. They ensure that operations across multiple services are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID), even in the face of failures or concurrency.

#### 1.3. Problematic of Distributed Transactions in a Microservices Architecture
However, implementing transactions in a microservices architecture presents unique challenges due to the decentralized nature of services, network latencies, and potential inconsistencies across service boundaries. Traditional transaction management techniques may not be directly applicable in such environments.

#### 1.4. Objective of the Proof of Concept (PoC) and of this Report
The primary objective of this Proof of Concept (PoC) is to explore and demonstrate various approaches to handling distributed transactions within a microservices architecture. This report serves as a comprehensive documentation of the research, design decisions, implementation strategies, and findings throughout the project lifecycle.

## Chapter 2: Theoretical Concepts

### SAGA Model

#### 2.1. Definition and Basic Principles
The SAGA model is a pattern for managing distributed transactions across multiple services. It decomposes a transaction into a series of smaller, compensating transactions that can be executed independently.

#### 2.2. Types of SAGA: Choreography vs Orchestration
SAGA can be implemented using choreography, where services collaborate by exchanging events to achieve the desired outcome, or orchestration, where a central coordinator manages the transaction flow.

#### 2.3. Advantages and Disadvantages of the SAGA Model
The SAGA model offers advantages such as increased scalability, fault tolerance, and flexibility. However, it also introduces complexity in terms of transaction management and coordination.

### Choreography in SAGA

#### 3.1. Definition of Choreography
Choreography in SAGA refers to the decentralized coordination of services through the exchange of events. Each service reacts to events emitted by other services, thereby collectively achieving the desired business logic.

#### 3.2. Comparison with Orchestration
Choreography differs from orchestration in that there is no central coordinator directing the transaction flow. Instead, services autonomously collaborate to accomplish the transactional workflow.

## Chapter 3: Architecture Design

### Description of the Architecture

#### 3.1. Overview of the Proposed Architecture
Our proposed architecture embodies the principles of microservices, comprising loosely coupled and independently deployable services. It incorporates mechanisms for handling distributed transactions, ensuring data consistency and fault tolerance.

#### 3.2. Definition of Participating Services
The participating services are designed to encapsulate specific business functionalities, promoting modularity and encapsulation. Each service communicates with others via well-defined APIs, adhering to the principles of service-oriented architecture (SOA).

### Modeling of Choreography Events

#### 3.3. Definition of Events
Events within the choreography represent significant business actions or state changes that trigger reactions from other services. These events are carefully defined to capture the essential aspects of the transactional workflow.

#### 3.4. Event Flows between Services
The flow of events between services follows predefined choreography patterns, ensuring that each service reacts appropriately to incoming events and emits relevant events to trigger subsequent actions.

#### 3.5. Management of Dependencies and Synchronization
Dependencies and synchronization between services are managed through event-driven architectures, where services subscribe to relevant events and react accordingly. This approach minimizes tight coupling and promotes scalability and resilience.

## Chapter 4: Implementation

### Choice of Technologies

#### 4.1. Programming Languages and Tools
We have carefully selected programming languages, frameworks, and tools that align with the principles of microservices and distributed systems. Our choices prioritize scalability, developer productivity, and community support.

#### 4.2. Collaboration Tools
Effective collaboration is essential for the success of any software project. We leverage a suite of collaboration tools to facilitate communication, version control, issue tracking, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

#### 4.3. Technologies Used
The technologies utilized in this project encompass a wide spectrum of tools and frameworks, including but not limited to containerization platforms, message brokers, databases, and monitoring solutions. Each technology is chosen based on its suitability for specific project requirements and constraints.

### Development of Microservices

#### 4.4. Implementation of Participating Services: Project Structure
The project structure for implementing participating services follows best practices in software engineering, including modular design, separation of concerns, and clear delineation of responsibilities. Each service is developed and deployed independently, facilitating rapid iteration and scaling.

#### 4.5. Tests and Validation
Testing and validation are integral parts of the development process, ensuring that each component functions as intended and meets the specified requirements. We employ a variety of testing methodologies, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, to validate the correctness and robustness of our system.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project represents a comprehensive exploration of distributed transactions within a microservices architecture. By leveraging theoretical concepts, architectural design principles, and practical implementation strategies, we have endeavored to address the challenges associated with distributed transaction management and provide insights into best practices for building scalable, resilient, and maintainable distributed systems.
